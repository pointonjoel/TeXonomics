# TeXonomics
A collection of Undergraduate-level Economics graphs and assorted TeX materials. All content is original work, which was learnt from Chiu Yu Ko's "Tikz Cookbook", found here: https://sites.google.com/site/kochiuyu/Tikz.

All work can be edited and reproduced free of charge (see license), but a footnote referencing the work I have done would be appreciated.
